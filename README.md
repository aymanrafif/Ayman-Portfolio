## Projects
Here, you can access the notebooks related to my projects within the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
- [Predicting Jakarta Air Quality Index: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Predicting-Jakarta-Air-Quality-Index/Classification-Using-Classifier-Models.ipynb)This is a project for the purposes of machine learning study, with the aim of developing a model capable of predicting the level of air pollution in Jakarta using classification algorithms.
- [Credit Score Prediction Using Machine Learning Models: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Credit-Score-Classification/Credit_Score_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Models.ipynb) The objective of this project is to explore machine learning models in predicting credit scores. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms and analyzing credit-related data, we aim to build a robust and reliable model that can accurately predict creditworthiness compared to traditional methods.
- [COVID-19 Overview with Tableau: ](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19OverviewinAmericaEuropeandAsia/COVID-19diBenuaAmerikaEropadanAsia?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) In the midst of a global pandemic, understanding the impact of COVID-19 across different regions is crucial. This project presents a comprehensive COVID-19 Overview Dashboard created using Tableau, focusing on three major continents: America, Europe, and Asia.
- [Stock Prediction Using Deep Learning Models: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/stock-prediction-using-deeplearning-models/Stock%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20Models.ipynb) The world of finance is driven by data and predictions, and in today's fast-paced market, having the ability to make informed decisions can be the key to success. This project, "Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning Models," harnesses the power of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to predict the stock prices of two prominent tech companies: AAPL (Apple Inc.) and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.).
