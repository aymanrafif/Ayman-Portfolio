Hello! My name is Ayman, and I am a highly motivated and passionate 3rd year Data Science Undergraduate Student at BINUS University. My journey in the world of data science has been both exciting and enriching, igniting an insatiable curiosity within me to explore the endless possibilities that data holds.

As a dedicated student, I have been actively involved in various academic and extracurricular activities. Currently, I am honored to serve as the General Treasurer at Himpunan Mahasiswa Teknik Informatika ([HIMTI](https://ofog.himti.or.id/)) BINUS, where I contribute my organizational and financial management skills to support the growth of the student community.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and programming languages like C, SQL, Python and R. I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills to tackle real-world challenges and make meaningful contributions to the field of data science.

If you are interested in discussing data-driven insights, problem-solving, or anything related to data science, feel free to reach out to me (aymanrafif00@gmail.com).

## Projects
Here, you can access the notebooks related to my projects within the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
- [Predicting Jakarta Air Quality Index: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Predicting-Jakarta-Air-Quality-Index/Classification-Using-Classifier-Models.ipynb)This is a project for the purposes of machine learning study, with the aim of developing a model capable of predicting the level of air pollution in Jakarta using classification algorithms.
- [Credit Score Prediction Using Machine Learning Models: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Credit-Score-Classification/Credit_Score_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_Models.ipynb) The objective of this project is to explore machine learning models in predicting credit scores. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms and analyzing credit-related data, we aim to build a robust and reliable model that can accurately predict creditworthiness compared to traditional methods.
- [COVID-19 Overview with Tableau: ](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19OverviewinAmericaEuropeandAsia/COVID-19diBenuaAmerikaEropadanAsia?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) In the midst of a global pandemic, understanding the impact of COVID-19 across different regions is crucial. This project presents a comprehensive COVID-19 Overview Dashboard created using Tableau, focusing on three major continents: America, Europe, and Asia.
- [Stock Prediction Using Deep Learning Models: ](https://github.com/aymanrafif/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/stock-prediction-using-deeplearning-models/Stock%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning%20Models.ipynb) The world of finance is driven by data and predictions, and in today's fast-paced market, having the ability to make informed decisions can be the key to success. This project, "Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning Models," harnesses the power of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), to predict the stock prices of two prominent tech companies: AAPL (Apple Inc.) and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.).
